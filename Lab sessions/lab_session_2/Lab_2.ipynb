The VTT of a traveller reflects the amount of money the traveller is **willing to pay** to reduce their travel time. The VTT is used to determine the benefits of new infrastructure projects. As travel time savings are the dominant and most salient benefits of new infrastructure, accurate inference of the distribution of the VTT is crucial for a rigorous underpinning of policy decisions. <br>\n",

The data set consists of 5,832 participants, resulting in a total of 52,488 choice observations.

But, as discussed under 3.3, we cannot specify $\\beta_{tc}$ as a randomly distributed parameter (or, to be more precise, not as one that uses a distribution which has support over the full domain, like a normal distribution). To circumvent this problem, we can cleverly re-parameterise our model. This reparametrisation involves a transformation from **`utility space`** to **`Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) space`**. This transformation allows us to estimate the VTT (distribution) directly, and simplifies the modelling. It works as follows:<br><br>\n",
